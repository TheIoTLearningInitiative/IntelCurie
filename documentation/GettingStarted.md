> Unleashing a Low-Power Hardware Module for Wearable and Other Consumer and Industrial Edge Devices

> Intel and Arduino join forces to bring you a development platform as powerful as your imagination. The first widely available learning and development board based on the Intel® Curie™ Compute Module, the Arduino 101 board (branded Genuino 101* outside the U.S.), delivers Intel performance at an entry-level price. Intel

Key Features

- A low-power, 32-bit Intel® Quark™ SE SoC
- 384kB Flash memory, 80kB SRAM
- A low-power integrated DSP sensor hub and pattern-matching technology enabling quick
and easy identification of actions and motions
- Bluetooth* Low Energy
- 6-axis combo sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope
- Battery charging circuitry (PMIC)

## Intel® IQ Software Kits

> Intel® IQ Software Kits combine algorithms, device software, application and cloud software to help customers incorporate advanced functionality into their wearable designs and provide a user experience that offers greater utility and value.

Intel IQ Software Kits include:

- Trust IQ establishes the identity of the user of the wearable device and enables personalized and secure experiences with services that require personal authentication.
- Time IQ aims to improve the efficiency of wearable users’ daily routines and accomplish tasks with contextually-aware notifications.
- Body IQ enables capabilities related to physical activities, including counting steps and calculating calories burned as well as providing data visualizations to help achieve goals.
- Social IQ supports social interactions, including communication via phone, social networks and
SMS with peers and brands.

## Enhanced Privacy Identification (EPID) technology

> Help secure an increasingly smart and connected world

> Intel’s EPID technology provides an “on-ramp” designed to help devices securely connect to the Intel® IoT Platform. Intel’s EPID hardware-enforced integrity provides fixed device identity in a manner that is compatible with existing ISO and TCG standards, and helps protect privacy with sophisticated anonymity technology
