## Enhanced Privacy Identification (EPID) technology

> Help secure an increasingly smart and connected world

> Intel’s EPID technology provides an “on-ramp” designed to help devices securely connect to the Intel® IoT Platform. Intel’s EPID hardware-enforced integrity provides fixed device identity in a manner that is compatible with existing ISO and TCG standards, and helps protect privacy with sophisticated anonymity technology
