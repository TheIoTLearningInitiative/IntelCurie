# Introduction

## Getting Started

> Unleashing a Low-Power Hardware Module for Wearable and Other Consumer and Industrial Edge Devices

> Intel and Arduino join forces to bring you a development platform as powerful as your imagination. The first widely available learning and development board based on the Intel® Curie™ Compute Module, the Arduino 101 board (branded Genuino 101* outside the U.S.), delivers Intel performance at an entry-level price.

> Key Features
  - A low-power, 32-bit Intel® Quark™ SE SoC
  - 384kB Flash memory, 80kB SRAM
  - A low-power integrated DSP sensor hub and pattern-matching technology enabling quick and easy identification of actions and motions
  - Bluetooth* Low Energy
  - 6-axis combo sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope
  - Battery charging circuitry (PMIC)
