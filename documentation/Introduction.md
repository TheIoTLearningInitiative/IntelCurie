# Introduction

> A learning and development board that delivers the performance and low-power consumption of the Intel® Curie™ Module with the simplicity of Arduino at an entry-level price. 
It keeps the same robust form factor and peripheral list of the UNO with the addition of onboard Bluetooth LE capabilities and a 6-axis accelerometer/gyro to help you easily expand your creativity into the connected world. [Arduino CC Homepage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101)

> The Brains Behind Your Next Invention. Building the next amazing thing just got easier. The Arduino 101* board packs powerful features that make creating a cinch, even for beginner Makers. And while it sells at an entry-level price point (starting at USD 29.99), it’s built for creating complex projects that require plenty of firepower. The brain behind the board is the Intel® Curie™ module, a powerful button-sized computer that has a built-in 6-axis combo sensor, Bluetooth* Low Energy radio, and low power usage, making it the perfect board for building “always-on” projects like fitness monitors. The Arduino 101 board may be the most amazing board yet, for the most amazing creations yet. [Intel Homepage](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/arduino-101.html)

> Unleashing a Low-Power Hardware Module for Wearable and Other Consumer and Industrial Edge Devices

> Intel and Arduino join forces to bring you a development platform as powerful as your imagination. The first widely available learning and development board based on the Intel® Curie™ Compute Module, the Arduino 101 board (branded Genuino 101* outside the U.S.), delivers Intel performance at an entry-level price. Arduino 101* is optimized to help you build the next generation of wearable tech. It features:
> > - A 32-bit Intel® Quark™ microcontroller (for minimal power consumption)
> > - An Intel® Curie™ module with 384 kB of flash memory (196 kB available to Arduino* sketch)
> > - 80 kb of SRAM (24 kB available for Arduino sketches)
> > - An integrated DSP sensor hub
> > - Bluetooth* Low Energy radio
> > - 6-axis combo sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope

> And with Arduino's open source hardware and software platforms, you'll be able to move from beginner to expert level in no time.
