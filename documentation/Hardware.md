## Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller

> Formerly Atlas Peak

> The Intel® Quark™ SE microcontroller brings intelligent power to the edge by combining a microcontroller with an onboard sensor subsystem to manage power consumption through programmable wake cues. Intel® Quark™ SE microcontroller also features pattern matching technology engine that allows it to learn and differentiate. The result is always-sensing intelligence, bringing real time response down to the next generation of intelligent devices. 

> 32-bit processor @ 32 MHz Intel® Pentium® x86-compatible without x87 floating point unit, 8 KB instruction cache, 2-way associative

## Nordic nRF51822

> Bluetooth Smart and 2.4GHz

> The nRF51822 is a powerful, highly flexible multiprotocol SoC ideally suited for Bluetooth® Smart (previously called Bluetooth low energy) and 2.4GHz ultra low-power wireless applications. The nRF51822 is built around a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™ M0 CPU with 256kB/128kB flash + 32kB/16kB RAM for improved application performance. The embedded 2.4GHz transceiver supports both Bluetooth Smart and the Nordic Gazell 2.4 GHz protocol stack which is on air compatible with the nRF24L series products from Nordic Semiconductor.
