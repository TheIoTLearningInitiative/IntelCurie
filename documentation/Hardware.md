## Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller

> Formerly Atlas Peak

> The Intel® Quark™ SE microcontroller brings intelligent power to the edge by combining a microcontroller with an onboard sensor subsystem to manage power consumption through programmable wake cues. Intel® Quark™ SE microcontroller also features pattern matching technology engine that allows it to learn and differentiate. The result is always-sensing intelligence, bringing real time response down to the next generation of intelligent devices. 

> 32-bit processor @ 32 MHz Intel® Pentium® x86-compatible without x87 floating point unit, 8 KB instruction cache, 2-way associative
