# Intel® Curie™ Open Developer Kit (ODK)

> The Intel Curie ODK includes the software, tools and documentation for developers to build boards based on the Intel® Curie™ module and turn them into products.

> The aim of the Intel Curie ODK is to help users develop their own boards starting with Arduino 101*(Genuino 101* outside the U.S.) or tinyTILE* boards, and later on using the open source schematics and board files, and via command line access the open source product firmware, the C++ class libraries, the entire hardware in the Intel® Curie™ module and other open sourced third-party code.
