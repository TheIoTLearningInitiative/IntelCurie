# Intel® Curie™ Open Developer Kit (ODK)

> The Intel Curie ODK includes the software, tools and documentation for developers to build boards based on the Intel® Curie™ module and turn them into products.

> The aim of the Intel Curie ODK is to help users develop their own boards starting with Arduino 101*(Genuino 101* outside the U.S.) or tinyTILE* boards, and later on using the open source schematics and board files, and via command line access the open source product firmware, the C++ class libraries, the entire hardware in the Intel® Curie™ module and other open sourced third-party code.  [Homepage](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/674972)

> The open software developer kit targets experienced developers familiar with embedded systems and C++ programming. Three firmware source trees are available for developers, with their respective compilers and debuggers:
> > - The A Tree provides access to Arduino 101 firmware and Arduino core libraries and tools. The A tree is available at [CODK-A Github](https://github.com/01org/CODK-A)
> > - The M tree is a mix of the A and Z trees. The firmware based on Zephyr* runs on the Intel® Quark™ processor core, and the user code with Arduino class libraries runs on the ARC EM core. The M tree is available at [CODK-M Github](https://github.com/01org/CODK-M)
> > - The Z tree is the version of Zephyr firmware that targets Arduino 101 as host core. The Z tree is available at [CODK-Z Github](https://github.com/01org/CODK-Z)
