## I2C

Arduino 101
===========
You will need to connect the Grove LCD via the shield onto the Arduino 101. Additionally, you will need to use 2 pull-up resistors (10k Ohm) between the SCL/SDA lines and 3.3V. The I2C lines on Quark SE Sensor Subsystem does not have internal pull-up, so external one is required.

## Sensors Subsystem

> 32-bit DSP core @ 32 MHz, Supporting ARCv2 ISA and floating point unit, 8 KB instruction cache, 2-way associative, 8 KB DCCM

## Pattern-Matching Accelerator

> Hardware pattern recognition IP, 128 neurons with 128 components per neuron

## Bosch BMI160 Inertial Measurement Unit

> The BMI160 is a small, low-power, low-noise 16 bit Inertial Measurement Unit designed for use in mobile applications such as augmented reality or indoor navigation which require highly accurate, real-time sensor
data.

## Nordic nRF51822

> Bluetooth Smart and 2.4GHz

> The nRF51822 is a powerful, highly flexible multiprotocol SoC ideally suited for Bluetooth® Smart (previously called Bluetooth low energy) and 2.4GHz ultra low-power wireless applications. The nRF51822 is built around a 32-bit ARM® Cortex™ M0 CPU with 256kB/128kB flash + 32kB/16kB RAM for improved application performance. The embedded 2.4GHz transceiver supports both Bluetooth Smart and the Nordic Gazell 2.4 GHz protocol stack which is on air compatible with the nRF24L series products from Nordic Semiconductor.
