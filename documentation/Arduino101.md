> A highly integrated hardware module that can power a solution the size of a button.

The Intel Curie Module includes:

- Low-power, 32-bit Intel®Quark™ microcontroller
- 384kB flash memory, 80kB SRAM
- Low-power, integrated DSP sensor hub and pattern matching technology
- Bluetooth Low Energy 6-axis combo sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope
- Battery charging circuitry (PMIC)

> A learning and development board that delivers the performance and low-power consumption of the Intel® Curie™ Module with the simplicity of Arduino at an entry-level price. 
It keeps the same robust form factor and peripheral list of the UNO with the addition of onboard Bluetooth LE capabilities and a 6-axis accelerometer/gyro to help you easily expand your creativity into the connected world. [Arduino CC Homepage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101)
